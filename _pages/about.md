I am currently a Ph.D. student at the **College of Computing and Data Science**, **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, where I am researching **Continual Learning** under the guidance of [Prof. Ying Wei](https://wei-ying.net/).

My research interests lie in **machine learning**, particularly in **continual learning**, **compositional learning** and **model model merging**. I aim to create models with **high efficiency** in both training and inference, while also mastering **multiple personalized tasks**.

Previously, I co-founded an AI music company, **Nanjing Qiyin Technology Co. Ltd.**, where we successfully completed a **million-level seed round financing** and received the **National Gold Medal** for our **Boya AI Music Project** at the 7th China College Students **"Internet+"** Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.

Although I no longer focus my efforts on AI music generation, I still maintain a high-performance Python [library](https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/symusic) for symbolic music data preprocessing in my spare time, as a contribution to the AI music open-source community.
