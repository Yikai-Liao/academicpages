## Projects

### [SyMusic](https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/symusic)  
> A fast note-level MIDI decoding library  
> Sep 2023  

- Developed **SyMusic**, a **cross-platform, note-level MIDI decoding library**, nearly **1000 times faster** than the widely-used **mido** library.
- Written in **C++** with a Python interface via [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind).
- ðŸŽ‰ Now published in [ISMIR 2024 LBD](https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/lbd_426.html#lbd)

### [Efficient BPE](https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/efficient_bpe)  
> An efficient implementation of BPE training algorithm  
> Apr 2023  

- Optimized the BPE training algorithm for token pair merging.
- Implemented in **pure Python**, outperforming the **Rust implementation** in Hugging Face's tokenizers.

### [Chord Recognizer](https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/chord_recognizer)  
> A fast chord extractor for MIDI  
> Sep 2022  

- Implemented a **hidden Markov chain** model to extract chord progressions, using the **Viterbi algorithm**.
- Accelerated with **Numba** for performance.
